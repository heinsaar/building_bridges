# Building Bridges

This is the code for a problem called "Building Bridges" ([problem A from the 2003 27th Annual acm International Collegiate Programming Contest World Finals]([url](https://icpc.global/worldfinals/problems/2003-ICPC-World-Finals/2003WorldFinalProblemSet.pdf))) I tackled during my final years at the university, and made it into my final (capstone) project in 2007.

It doesn't compile today as it was written with an older compiler of Visual Studio 6.0, which back then didn't conform to the standard C++ very well.
